In this project, I performed a detailed analysis of patients who had low vision that presented to Guinnes Eye Center, Onitsha, a tertiary health facility in Nigeria, where I did my ophthalmology posting in my penultimate level in medical school. The analysis yielded some actionable insights, from which I deduced my recommendations.
