## Skills
Power BI, DAX, data modeling, data analysis, data transformation and data visualization. 
## Project Context
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), low vision is defined as a visual acuity of less than 6/18 to 3/60 in the better eye with the best possible correction. This definition is based on the WHO's [International Classification of Diseases (ICD)](https://ecoo.info/2011/03/position-paper-low-vision/) and is widely accepted globally. Visual acuity(the clarity or sharpness of vision) is obtained on clinical examination using a [Snellen chart](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24421-visual-acuity-test).
Many eye diseases predispose individuals to low vision, and some even progress to permanent blindness.

In this project, all the patient records in [Guinness Eye Centre, Onitsha](https://africaresearchconnects.com/institution/9000693622/) for October 2024 were taken, and patients who had low vision were selected, filtered and analyzed to uncover patterns and eye diseases most commonly associated with low vision in the centre. This work was part of my ophthalmology posting project in my penultimate year of medical school at [Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital](https://www.nauthnnewi.org.ng/).

Using Power BI, I developed an interactive and visually intuitive dashboard that produced several valuable insights on low vision at Guinness Eye Centre and proffered some public health interventions to reduce the incidence of low vision.
### Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations are paramount in research involving human subjects. Approval to use the hospital records was obtained from the Head of the records department and the patient records were anonymized to comply with ethical standards.

## What I Analyzed
The dataset, titled “survey lung cancer,” contains categorical and numerical data collected from a group of individuals, including
